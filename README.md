# MATH129A - Introduction to Linear Algebra
### Created by Zayd Hammoudeh

**Semester:** Spring 2017

**Instructor:** Dr. Anastasia Pryvarnikova

**Institution:** San Jose State University

This contains my study notes, exams, and homeworks from when I took linear algebra.

No direct copying should **ever** be done from the work of others.  That defeats the whole purpose of attending school, which is to learn.
